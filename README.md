## TaskCollab

### App Details
This is a simple project collaboration app built with Sinatra and the following
specs:

```
ActiveRecord (ORM)
PostgreSQL (production database)
SQLITE (development database)
Pony (email library)
Puma (server)
Vanilla CSS/Javascript (no frameworks)
```

The app demonstrates key ruby/rails components such as:

- authentication (bcrypt)
- associations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- crud
- http requests/responses
- sessions/cookies
- flash messages
- basic security
- 

My primary focus while building this app was to avoid using major frameworks
such as Bootstrap, React, or Rails in order to demonstrate my understanding
of some the most important lower-level layers of web development.
